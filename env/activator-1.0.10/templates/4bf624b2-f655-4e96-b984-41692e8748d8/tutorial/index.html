    <title>Hello Slick - Activator Template</title>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>

    <p>You've just created a basic Slick application. Let's take a closer look at what's happening in this
        project. First of all, you need to add Slick and te embedded databases or drivers for external databases
        to your project. We have already taken care of this for you in the <a href="#code/build.sbt"
        class="shortcut">build.sbt</a> file.</p>
    <p>Slick uses <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a> for its own debug
        logging so you also need to add an SLF4J implementation. Here we are using <code>slf4j-nop</code> to disable
        logging. You have to replace this with a real logging framework like
        <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a> if you want to see log output.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Imports</h2>
    <p>Let's move on to <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Hello.scala" class="shortcut">src/main/scala/Hello.scala</a> which contains the
        scaffolding for the application. It starts off with some imports:</p>

    <pre><code>// Use H2Driver to connect to an H2 database
import scala.slick.driver.H2Driver.simple._

// Use the implicit threadLocalSession
import Database.threadLocalSession</code></pre>

    <p>Since we are using <a href="http://h2database.com/">H2</a> as our database system, we need to import features
        from Slick's <code>H2Driver</code>. A driver's <code>simple</code> object contains all commonly
        needed imports from the driver and other parts of Slick such as session handling. The only extra import we use
        is the <code>threadLocalSession</code>. This simplifies the session handling by attaching a session to the
        current thread so you do not have to pass it around on your own (or at least assign it to an implicit
        variable).</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Database Connection</h2>
    <p>In the body of the application we create a <code>Database</code> object which specifies
        how to connect to a database, and then immediately open a session, running all
        code within the following block inside that session:</p>

    <pre><code>Database.forURL("jdbc:h2:mem:test1", driver = "org.h2.Driver") withSession {
  // The session is never named explicitly. It is bound to the current
  // thread as the threadLocalSession that we imported
}</code></pre>

    <p>In a Java SE environment, database sessions are usually created by connecting to a JDBC URL using a JDBC driver
        class (see the JDBC driver's documentation for the correct URL syntax). If you are only using <em>plain SQL
        queries</em></a>, nothing more is required, but when Slick is generating SQL code for you (using the
        <em>direct embedding</em></a> or the <em>lifted embedding</em>), you need to make sure to use a matching Slick
        driver (in our case the <code>H2Driver</code> import above).</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Schema</h2>

    <p>We are using the lifted embedding in this application, so we have to write <code>Table</code> objects for our
        database tables. You can define these at the top level of the source file or inside the app or <code>
        withSession</code> block:</p>

    <pre><code>// Definition of the SUPPLIERS table
class Suppliers extends Table[(Int, String, String, String, String, String)]("SUPPLIERS") {
  def id = column[Int]("SUP_ID", O.PrimaryKey) // This is the primary key column
  def name = column[String]("SUP_NAME")
  def street = column[String]("STREET")
  def city = column[String]("CITY")
  def state = column[String]("STATE")
  def zip = column[String]("ZIP")
  // Every table needs a * projection with the same type as the table's type parameter
  def * = id ~ name ~ street ~ city ~ state ~ zip
}
val Suppliers = new Suppliers

// Definition of the COFFEES table
class Coffees extends Table[(String, Int, Double, Int, Int)]("COFFEES") {
  def name = column[String]("COF_NAME", O.PrimaryKey)
  def supID = column[Int]("SUP_ID")
  def price = column[Double]("PRICE")
  def sales = column[Int]("SALES")
  def total = column[Int]("TOTAL")
  def * = name ~ supID ~ price ~ sales ~ total
  // A reified foreign key relation that can be navigated to create a join
  def supplier = foreignKey("SUP_FK", supID, Suppliers)(_.id)
}
val Coffees = new Coffees
</code></pre>

    <p>All columns get a name (usually in camel case for Scala and upper case with
        underscores for SQL) and a Scala type (from which the SQL type can be derived
        automatically). Make sure to define them with <code>def</code> and not with <code>val</code>.
        The table object also needs a Scala name, SQL name and type. The type argument
        of the table must match the type of the special <code>*</code> projection. In simple
        cases this is a tuple of all columns but more complex mappings are possible.</p>

    <p>The <code>foreignKey</code> definition in the <code>Coffees</code> table ensures that the
        <code>supID</code> field can only contain values for which a corresponding <code>id</code>
        exists in the <code>Suppliers</code> table, thus creating an <em>n to one</em> relationship:
        A <code>Coffees</code> row points to exactly one <code>Suppliers</code> row but any number
        of coffees can point to the same supplier. This constraint is enforced at the
        database level.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Populating the Database</h2>

    <p>The connection to the embedded H2 database engine provides us with an empty
        database. Before we can execute queries, we need to create the database schema
        (consisting of the <code>Coffees</code> and <code>Suppliers</code> tables) and insert some test
        data. We can do this with the following code inside the <code>withSession</code> block:</p>

    <pre><code>// Create the tables, including primary and foreign keys
(Suppliers.ddl ++ Coffees.ddl).create

// Insert some suppliers
Suppliers.insert(101, "Acme, Inc.",      "99 Market Street", "Groundsville", "CA", "95199")
Suppliers.insert( 49, "Superior Coffee", "1 Party Place",    "Mendocino",    "CA", "95460")
Suppliers.insert(150, "The High Ground", "100 Coffee Lane",  "Meadows",      "CA", "93966")

// Insert some coffees (using JDBC's batch insert feature, if supported by the DB)
Coffees.insertAll(
  ("Colombian",         101, 7.99, 0, 0),
  ("French_Roast",       49, 8.99, 0, 0),
  ("Espresso",          150, 9.99, 0, 0),
  ("Colombian_Decaf",   101, 8.99, 0, 0),
  ("French_Roast_Decaf", 49, 9.99, 0, 0)
)
</code></pre>

    <p>The tables' <code>ddl</code> methods create <code>DDL</code> (data definition language) objects
        with the database-specific code for creating and dropping tables and other
        database entities. Multiple <code>DDL</code> values can be combined with <code>++</code> to
        allow all entities to be created and dropped in the correct order, even when
        they have circular dependencies on each other.</p>
    <p>Inserting the tuples of data is done with the <code>insert</code> and <code>insertAll</code>
        methods. Note that by default a database <code>Session</code> is in <em>auto-commit</em> mode.
        Each call to the database like <code>insert</code> or <code>insertAll</code> executes atomically
        in its own transaction (i.e. it succeeds or fails completely but can never
        leave the database in an inconsistent state somewhere in between). In this
        mode we we have to populate the <code>Suppliers</code> table first because the
        <code>Coffees</code> data can only refer to valid supplier IDs.</p>
    <p>We could also use an explicit transaction bracket encompassing all these
        statements. Then the order would not matter because the constraints are only
        enforced at the end when the transaction is committed.</p>

    <p>Now that we have some code that accesses the database, it is time to
        <a class="shortcut" href="#run">Run</a> the app for the first time. It should complete
        without errors but it doesn't produce any output yet.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Querying</h2>

    <p>The simplest kind of query iterates over all the data in a table. Add the following lines of code
    at the end (but still inside) of the <code>withSession</code> block:</p>

    <pre><code>// Iterate through all coffees and output them
Query(Coffees) foreach { case (name, supID, price, sales, total) =>
  println("  " + name + "\t" + supID + "\t" + price + "\t" + sales + "\t" + total)
}</code></pre>

    <p>This corresponds to <code>SELECT * FROM COFFEES</code> in SQL (except that the <code>*</code>
        is the table's <code>*</code> projection we defined earlier and not whatever the
        database sees as <code>*</code>). The type of the values we get in the loop is,
        unsurprisingly, the type parameter of <code>Coffees</code>.</p>

    <p>If you <a class="shortcut" href="#run">Run</a> the app again you should see the following output:</p>

    <pre><code>Colombian 101 7.99 0 0
French_Roast 49 8.99 0 0
Espresso 150 9.99 0 0
Colombian_Decaf 101 8.99 0 0
French_Roast_Decaf 49 9.99 0 0</code></pre>

    <p>Let's add a <em>projection</em> to this basic query. This is written in Scala with
        the <code>map</code> method or a <em>for comprehension</em>:</p>

    <pre><code>val q1 = for(c <- Coffees) // Coffees lifted automatically to a Query
yield ConstColumn("  ") ++ c.name ++ "\t" ++ c.supID.asColumnOf[String] ++
    "\t" ++ c.price.asColumnOf[String] ++ "\t" ++ c.sales.asColumnOf[String] ++
    "\t" ++ c.total.asColumnOf[String]
q1 foreach println</code></pre>

    <p>The output will be the same: For each row of the table, all columns get
        converted to strings and concatenated into one tab-separated string. The
        difference is that all of this now happens inside the database engine, and
        only the resulting concatenated string is shipped to the client. Note that we
        avoid Scala's <code>+</code> operator (which is already heavily overloaded) in favor of
        <code>++</code> (commonly used for sequence concatenation). Also, there is no automatic
        conversion of other argument types to strings. This has to be done explicitly
        with the type conversion method <code>asColumnOf</code>.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>Joining and Filtering</h2>

    <p>Joining and filtering tables is done the same way as when working with Scala collections:</p>

    <p>Note the use of <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code> for comparing two values for
        equality. Similarly, the lifted embedding uses <code>=!=</code> instead of <code>!=</code> for
        inequality. (The other comparison operators are the same as in Scala:
        <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>.)</p>

    <pre><code>// Perform a join to retrieve coffee names and supplier names for
// all coffees costing less than $9.00
val q2 = for {
  c <- Coffees if c.price < 9.0
  s <- Suppliers if s.id === c.supID
} yield (c.name, s.name)
for(t <- q2) println("  " + t._1 + " supplied by " + t._2)</code></pre>

    <p>The generator expression <code>Suppliers if s.id === c.supID</code> follows the
        relationship established by the foreign key <code>Coffees.supplier</code>. Instead of
        repeating the join condition here we can use the foreign key directly:</p>

    <pre><code>val q2 = for {
  c <- Coffees if c.price < 9.0
  s <- c.supplier
} yield (c.name, s.name)</code></pre>

    <p>Instead of iterating over the results we could also read it into a <code>List</code> and then
        iterate over that:</p>

    <pre><code>val l2: List[(String, String)] = q2.list
for((s1, s2) <- l2) println("  " + s1 + " supplied by " + s2)</code></pre>
