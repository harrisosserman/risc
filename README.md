After pulling the repo:
1.  Install MongoDB
2.  After mongodb is installed, run this: sudo chown -R <your-username> /data/db
Use the username of your computer (in the users directory of your mac)
3.  In the command line inside of the directory that mongodb was installed, run: mongod, and make sure that there are no errors
Make sure that you run mongod whenever you try to use our Play application
4.  Then follow these instructions to start the Typesafe Activator/Play framework.  No need to download the Play framework because it is part of this repo:  http://www.playframework.com/download

To run the app, run risc/activator ui from the terminal
