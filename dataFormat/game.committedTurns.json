NOTE: There will be n documents in the committedTurns collection per game, where n is the number of players in the game
NOTE: The number of troops attacking is not included in the total number of troops in a territory.
So, if I were to decide not to attack the territories that I am attacking, the total number of troops in the territory would be:
5 + 2 + 1 = 8 total troops for the example above
NOTE: If the player is not attacking anyone at that territory, then the attacking array will be empty
